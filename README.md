This page is designed for new recruits who wish to join Harley's team. It has training times and a small biography of Harley. All new recruits will be given this site as a starting point and through the [Sign Up](sign-up.html) page, can register intrest in joining the team. A [Gallery](gallery.html) has been added to show pictures of cricket being played by Harley's Team.

## **Testing**

HTML and CSS testing was done through `W3C` validator:

- [Home Page](index.html) had 2 issues with not having headings in a section tag.

- [Gallery Page](gallery.html) had 2 issues with not having headings in a section tag.

- [CSS stylesheet](style.css) has no issues 

Both issues have been delibarated on and the page does not require headings at these points
