                <p>Harley learnt how to play cricket in the nets with his friend. That friend was the best spin bowler in the state and passed on his knowledge to Harley.
                    It was this 'trail by fire' approach that Harley used to teach all grades of cricket today. Harley believes that practice makes perfect and thus training sessions will be
                    full of net hitting and bowling, fielding and game stradegy. With a combination of stadegy and net sessions, Harley's Cricket Team is aiming for a great year. 
                    At 28 years of Age, Harley can connect well with our junior players as well as be in good standing with our senior team. Harley has a cooking background so you can expect
                    great BBQ's after games.
